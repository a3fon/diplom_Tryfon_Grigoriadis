3 scenarios of Federated Learning with 3 client selection algorithms to test the efficiency and accuracy of them. The first algorithm is random, the second one is based on the accuracy of the clients and the third is based on the importance of each client relevant to the global model

The code is designed to run multiple loops with different fractions of clients. You can change the number of clients in federated.py and choose or modify the client selection algorithm in ml/fl/selectors.py in any of the examples
